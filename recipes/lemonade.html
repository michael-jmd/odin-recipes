            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>It couldn't be easier to make this homemade lemonade with just a few simple ingredients you probably already have on hand.</p>
            <h5>Sugar and Water</h5>
            <p>What makes this lemonade so special? The recipe starts with a simple syrup, which is just a fancy way of saying the first step is dissolving sugar in boiling water. This ensures the finished drink is totally cohesive and smooth (and it prevents sugar from collecting at the bottom of the pitcher).</p>
            <h5>Lemon Juice</h5>
            <p>Obviously, you'll need lemon juice to make homemade lemonade. Freshly squeezed juice is definitely the way to go if you have fresh lemons available, but bottled juice will work in a pinch.</p>
            <h5>Ice</h5>
            <p>There's nothing like a refreshing glass of ice cold lemonade to cool you down on a hot day. Just make sure to add the ice right before serving — you don't want it to dilute the sweet flavor.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>9 medium lemons, or more as needed</li>
                <li>7 cups ice-cold water</li>
                <li>ice as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Combine sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Stir to dissolve sugar while mixture comes to a boil. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half crosswise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring cup. Add pulp to the juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 1/2 cups fresh juice and pulp.</li>
                <li>Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.</li>
            </ol>
